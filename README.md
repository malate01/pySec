For my experiments with Howard E Poston's _Python for Cybersecurity_


Mr Poston's book is available here (non-affiliate link): https://www.amazon.com/Python-Cybersecurity-Using-Offense-Defense/dp/1119850649/

For further information the books official website is: https://www.wiley.com/go/pythonforcybersecurity

No copyright or other intellectual property infringement is intended, this is for my own use and putting it out there for anyone who may benefit from my process working through Mr Poston's book in exploring Python for infosec (offensive and defensive) as well as the MITRE ATT&CK Framework ( https://attack.mitre.org/ ).  If putting this here causes any problems please contact me and I will remedy anything which is required.
